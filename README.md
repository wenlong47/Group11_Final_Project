# NYC Traffic Crash trends: A Post-Covid Analysis
Introduction:   
In our project, we take a look into the impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns on traffic collisions in New York City. The project is centered around the idea of exploring how these unprecedented lockdowns, which drastically changed urban lifestyles, particularly in one of the world's most congested cities, influenced road safety and traffic patterns. This exploration is not only timely but also crucial for understanding the pandemic's broader effects on urban mobility.

Data set:  
The dataset for our project, encompasses comprehensive information on motor vehicle collisions in New York City, spanning from 2012 to 2023. This data, which is derived from all police-reported motor vehicle collisions in the city, is meticulously compiled in the Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table. Each row in this table details a specific crash event, offering a granular view of the circumstances and outcomes of these incidents. The dataset's foundation is the police report MV-104-AN, which is mandated for collisions involving injury, death, or property damage exceeding $1000. It's important to note that this dataset is preliminary and may be subject to revisions, as the MV-104AN forms can be amended with updated crash details.
